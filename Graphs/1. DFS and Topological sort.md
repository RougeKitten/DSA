## Connected Components:
- In an undirected graph, the connected components are those segments in which you can move from one edge to the other. 
  ![[Pasted image 20221020173636.png]]
- All the parts in red are connected components of the graph. 
- If you take any two nodes belonging to one component, they are connected. If not, they are unconnected. 
## Ways to store the graph in your program:
### Adjancency Matrix
- Adjacency Matrix: We create an `n x n` matrix (n is the number of edges) and based on which edge is connecting to which we put a one in the matrix, and for the remaining, we fill them with zeros.
  ![[Pasted image 20221020174835.png]]
- We do not use this generally, because this takes place too much memory O(n<sup>2</sup> ), which is not required since the max limit for the number of edges is less than that. Hence we will store it in the form of a list. 
- For the case of an undirected graph, we would have a symetrical matrix: i.e if `[i][j] is one, then [j][i] will also be 1`
- 

### Adjacency List
- For each node, we will simply store which node is connected to which other node
  ![[Pasted image 20221020175639.png]]
- Total number of elements in all the lists would be equal to the number of edges which is equal to m. (for a directed graph)
	- For an undirected graph, each edge would be present twice in the list `i -> j, then j -> i`
- Hence the SC is O(m). 
	- If the graph is full , i.e all the nodes are connected to each other, then we need not give much thought as to which method should we use to store the graph since there would be edges in the order of O(n<sup>2</sup> ). 
	- If graph is not full, it is better to use this list representation.
- **We will have n lists and the total size of all these lists would be O(m)**

## Algorithm to find the connected components in a graph (Depth-First Search)
- We Start off with any node of the graph, then we start the recurrive procedure as follows:
	- visit every edge of this node, and mark that as visited, then call the function for this node. 
- After one run, we will have marked all the edges which belong to the same component of the node which we had called initially.
- This is how the recursive function will execute it's calls:
  ![[Pasted image 20221020182058.png]]
```cpp
	dfs(v){ //we pass the node which we want to apply the recursive function on.
		visited[v] = true; // mark this node as visited
		for(x : adj[v]){ //go to all the neighbours of v
			if(!visited[x]) // if any neighbour has not been visited, we call this function to it again.
				dfs(x)
		}
	} 
```

### How to prove that this algorithm actually works?
- We need to prove that if we start dfs from some node, everything connected to this node will be marked, and nothing else will be marked.
- More formally if we call dfs on a node v, `u is connected to v <=> u is marked`
- Proving this from RHS = LHS
	- Let's say that the node u is connected to some other node s, and from the above statement, since u is marked and s is connected to u, then s would also be marked. 
	- And since v is connected to u and u is connected to s, we can also say that v is connected to s (there exists some path to go from v to s). 
### Time Complexity:
- For each node, we will be calling the dfs function at max once. 
	- For each node, we will be calling the nodes connecting to the nodes. 
- Hence TC: O(n + m), and since 

## Unique case of directed acyclic graph
- For such graphs, we can have something like a topological sort
- Topological sorting is a way to represent the graph such that if `u -> v, then u would be placed before v in the topological sort`
- This basically means a linear arrangement of the graph in which all the edges will go from left to right
  ![[Pasted image 20221020185642.png]]
- Such a representation only exists for a directed acyclic graph. 
### Real life implications of topological sort:
- If we have a set a libraries such that the libraries are dependent on each other, then we would want to load the libraries in such a way that all the required libraries for the functioning of the given library have already been loadd.
- Topological sort gives you the order in which the libraries must be loaded.
- DP algos can also be applied on the topological representation of the graph

### Making a Topological sorting using dfs
- The approach is that at the end of every dfs call, we add the node to the list. 
- At the end, this would give us the topological sort in the reverse direction
```cpp
	dfs(v){ //we pass the node which we want to apply the recursive function on.
		visited[v] = true; // mark this node as visited
		for(x : adj[v]){ //go to all the neighbours of v
			if(!visited[x]) // if any neighbour has not been visited, we call this function to it again.
				dfs(x)
		}
		ts.push_back(i); //we have no where to go after this node, so we can simply output it
	} 
```
- Topological sort for a graph may not be unique. See the above example, two topo sorts exists. 
#### Proof of topological sort
- How can i prove that the sorting which i have is topological or not?
- if we consider the following pair `u -> v` then in the topological sorting u should come before v.
- Now when we do a recursive approach in which for every node, we call it's neighbours, it that case the dfs call for v would get completed before that of u. Hence in our case, v will get printed before u. This is the reverse of the topological order. 

- One edge case: if one of the nodes has been marked, but is not yet added to the topological sorting order: is this even possible?
	- No: because if a node has been marked and not added to the Ts, and now we are trying to visited the node again, this means that the node somehow is connected to itself, which proves the existance of a cycle in the Directed Graph. And a TS only exists for Acyclic Directed graphs
	- Why cant we make a TS of a cyclic graph: because there is no way possible to show a cycle in a linear arrangement in which all the edges go from left to right.
		- Thinking in terms of the libraries example from above, such an operation would mean a self depending library, which is not possible.

### Iterative way to make the Topological sorting (Kahn's Algorithm):
#### Concept of ingoing vs outgoing edges: 
- An ingoing edge is the one which is directed towards the node, 
- while an outgoing edge is the one which moves away form the node. 


- Now, when we consider the first element of the topological sorting, it has zero ingoing edges. So we need to find all the edges and then select the one which has no ingoing edges. Now we remove this element from the graph and do the same process.
![[Pasted image 20221021020922.png]]
- This is generally implemented using an iterative method:
```cpp
	queue<int> q; //we take a help of an queue to store all the nodes which have zero inedges in the order in which they wouild appear in the TS
    for(int i = 0; i < v; ++i){
        if(!inEdge[i]) //if there are no inedges.
            q.push(i);
    }
    
    vector<int> ans;
    
    while(!q.empty()){
        int t = q.front();
        q.pop();
        
        ans.push_back(t);
        for(int x : adj[t]){
            inEdge[x]--; //since we are removing the node t, then for all the nodes which are connected to t, they would have one less ingoing edge.
            if(!inEdge[x])
                q.push(x);
        }
    }
    return ans;
```
- TC - `O(n + m)`

## Checking if your directed graph is cyclic or not: 
#### using the iterative method:
- Before getting a topological sorting, we need to first see if there exists any cycle in the graph or not. Because if a cycle exists, then it is not possible to have a TS. 
- We can check this using the linear TS algo: 
	- If a cycle exists, we will come across a case where in after removing a previous elements, we would come across a position in which the queue is there is no node which has a 0 ingoing egde left. 
	  ![[Pasted image 20221021023257.png]]
	- In such a case, the TS we get will not contain all the which are present in the graph:
		- `length of the TS != number of nodes in the graph ==> cycle exists`
- Hence we can run the TS algo and if at the end there are no all the nodes present, this means that a cycle is present in the graph.
#### using recursion/ DFS
- It is very easy to see that if we use a normal method DFS on a cyclic graph, it will put all the elements in the Topological sort, but how do we check if it is the correct sorting or not?
- We had disccused a situation before that if we encounter a case in which we have visited a node and not yet added in the TS, then if we again try to visit that node, this means that there exists a cycle here. 
- Thus, we need to keep a track of three states for each node, when it is not visited, when it is in the middle of a recursive cycle and when the recursive cycle for that particular element has been completely over. 
- The visited vector which we used in dfs, we use it to store this. `0 == not visited, 1 == visited and recursion cycle is in process 2 == visited and recursion cycle is over`
```cpp
bool isCyclic(int i, vector<vector<int>> &adj, vector<int> &visited){
    visited[i] = 1;
    for(auto x : adj[i]){
        if(visited[x] == 1) return true;
        if(visited[x] == 0){
            if(isCyclic(x, adj, visited))
                return true;
        }
    }
    visited[i] = 2;
    return false;
}	
```


## DFS Recursion tree analysis of a graph
![[Pasted image 20221021031856.png]]
- The teal edges represents the states which can be possible, and the red one whic cannot be possible. 
- An edge which goes from left to right is not possible in the recursion tree because, 
	- if it was possible, it would have been a part of the recurssion tree itself.
- However an edge from right to left is possible, because when we come to the right edge, we see that the left one has already been visited, hence it is not called.
- Thus in a nut shell, extra edges may go
	- down
	- up (cycle is present)
	- right -> left
- but they cannot go
	- left -> right
