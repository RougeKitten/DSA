## Multiplicative Modulo Inverse.
```
What is a multiplicative inverse?
- b is the Multiplicative Inverse of a if a*b = 1


Similarly, 
- b is the multiplicative modulo inverse of a if (a*b)%m = 1
eg, if a = 6, m = 7 ==> b = 6.

Imp Property -> MMI will only exsist when the GCD(a,m) == 1.
```

## Approach
```
We need to find b such that, 
	(a*b)%m = 1
	(a*b)%m - 1 = 0 => this can be re-written as
	a*b - 1 = k*m (k is a constant)
	a*b + m*k' = 1 (k' = -k)
	This equation is similar to
	a*x + m*y = GCD(a,m) [if and only if the gcd of a&m is 1]. 

Thus, we can run the extended euclid's algo on a and m, and the value of x we
get from it is our required modulo multiplicative inverse. 
```
## Code
```cpp
ll gcd(ll a, ll b){ return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a%b); }

ll x, y, GCD;

void extendedEuclid(ll a, ll b){
	//base case
	if(b == 0){
		x = 1;
		y = 0;
		GCD = a;
		return;
	}

	extendedEuclid(b, a%b);

	ll cx, cy;
	cx = y;
	cy = x - (a/b)*y;
	x = cx;
	y = cy;
}

void inverseModulo(ll a, ll m){
	if(gcd(a,m) == 1){
		extendedEuclid(a, m);
	}
	else
		x = 0;
}

int main(){
	ll a, m;
	cin >> a >> m;
	inverseModulo(a,m);
	print((x + m) % m); // to make it positive
}
```
