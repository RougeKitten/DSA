# GCD and Euclids Algorithm

## Recap
```
GCD/HCF - Greatest Common Divisor. (the largest number which divides the two given nos)

Brute Force Approach:
1. Iterate from 1 to min(a,b) and check for every value if it divides both. 
This is a verry ineffective approach. 
```
## Euclid's Algorithm for GCD
```
Recursive Def: GCD(a,b) = GCD(b, a%b) [make sure that a > b]
GCD(a,0) = a;
```
```cpp
ll gcd(ll a, ll b){
	//base case
	if(b == 0)
		return a;
	return gcd(b, a%b);
}

int main(){
	ll a, b;
	cin >> a >> b;
	cout << ((a > b) ? gcd(a, b) : gcd(b, a));
}
```

## Time complexity of GCD
```
GCD(a,b) = GCD(b, a%b)
if we consider a%b to be x, 
we know that the range of x is [0, b - 1].

Also, a%b can be also written as a - floor(a/b)*b [closest multiple of b less than a]
Since the min value of floor(a/b) can be 1 (a > b), 
therefore, a% b <= a - b ==> x <= a - b

combining this with the range of x, we see that x < a/2.

thus gcd(a,b) = gcd(b, a/2) = gcd(a/2, ...)
Hence, TC - O(loga).
