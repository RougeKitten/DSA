# Linear Diophantine Equations

```
A Diophantine equation is a polynomial equation, usually in two or more variables,
such that only the itegral solutions are required. An intergral solution is a 
solutions such that all the variables take integer values only. 

Eg) ax + by = c. 

Sample problem: Given three integers a,b,c which represent ax + by = c. 
Determine if the equation has a solution such that x and y both are integers.

Approach:
ax + by = c.
Let g = gcd(a,b) => a = g*k1, b = g*k2

thus k1x + k2y = c/g. Since the right hand side is linear, therefore the left
hand side is also linear. 

hence a solution is possible if and only if c % g == 0. 

If(Xo, Yo) is one possible solution for the equation, then there will be infinitely
many solutions possible for this equation. 

General solution: 
{x, y} = {Xo + (b/g)*t, Yo - (a/g)*t}


How do we find the values of Xo and Yo ? use extended eucledian method. 

if the solution of ax + by = gcd(a,b) is x1, y1
then the solution of the eqn ax + by = k*gcd(a,b) = kx1, ky1. 
```
Special thing about these type of equations is that, if one solution exists, that
mean there are infinitely many solutions possible.
