# Modulo Properties

```
1. (a+b)%m = (a%m + b%m)%m;
2. (a-b)%m = (a%m - b%m + m)%m;
	the extra m is added to handle the negative cases.
3. (a*b)%m = ((a%m)*(b%m))%mod
4. (a/b)%m = ((a%m)*(b'%m))%mod
	b' -> multiplicative modulo inverse. 
```

## Fast Modulo Exponentiation using bitmasks
```
The normal fast exponentiation uses a recursive approach.
When we are doing a modulo, we can avoid using the extra space that is used by
the recursive call stack by using bitmasks. 

Steps:
1. Initialise the ans to be 1. 
2. check the right most bit of b, if it is one, we multiply the ans by a.
   if it is zero, we do nothing. 
3. Then we square the value of a and left shift b by 1. 
4. We continue to do this until we b > 0. 

TC -> O(logb) [No of bits in b is logb + 1]
```
```cpp
ll FastModularExp(ll a, ll b, ll m){
	ll res = 1;

	while(b > 0){
		if(b&1){
			res = (res*a) % m;
		}
		a = (a*a) % m;
		b = b >> 1;
	}
	return res;
}
```
