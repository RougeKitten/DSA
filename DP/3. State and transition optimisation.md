# State Optimisation
- Ask yourself this question, do you really need all the parameters present in the dp state?
	- If the state is `dp[a][b][c]` and `a + b = c` then you really don't need ti store c, you can just compute it on the spor.
- Can you compute a parameter from the some of the remaining parameters?
- You should also aim to remove the parameter with the largest range

# Transition Optimisation
- We can optimise the transition times in a dp problem by using some addtional space to store some required answers. 
- For example:
	`dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[1-2] + dp[i-3] ... dp[0]`
	can also be written as `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-1]`
