# Why do we need this?
- Consider an array of n integers,
	- We can generate 2<sup>n</sup> subsets(including the empty one). 
	- To store all these subsets, we require n x 2<sup>n</sup>.
- Instead of doind that, we can represent the subsets with the help of an bitmask. 
```
  Consider the array [10,20,30]
  Here, we can assign a bit number in the following manner: 
  0th bit -> 10 (lsb)
  1st bit -> 20
  2nd bit -> 30

  so, if we want to represent the subset, we can simply do it by [101] which is the binary representation of 5
  [10,20,30] -> 111 (7)
  
```
- What we are doing here is that we are assigning every single subset possible to a number, so that the space required to store these subsets reduces to just an integer.(2<sup>n</sup> in total)

# Bitmasking in DP
- Suppose we have a dp state in which the value of the state depends upon what all choices have we made in the previous states.
- For such a case, we would obviously have to store all the possible options, but we can represent all the possibilities with the help of a bitmask and so we will be able to store all the options we have selected without adding much additional space. 
- the dp state would look like `dp[i][bitmask]` . 
- Limitations: we will need 2<sup>n</sup> integers to store all the subsets. So practially, since we need to store all of these values, n <= 21 [hint for observing dp with bitmasking problem]

# Sample problem: 
```
Given a list of points on a 2D plane, rearrange these points in any way such that in the final permutation of points, the sum of distances of the adjacent elements is minimized.

Constraints: [N <= 15], [-1e9 <= Xi, Yi <=1e9]

Points : [{0, 0}, {5, 6}, {1, 2}]

Best permutation -> [{0, 0}, {1, 2}, {5, 6}]]Â 

Ans = Dist(P1, P3) + Dist(P3, P2)
```

- state: `dp[i][bitmask][last element]: minimum sum of distances in the suffix[i...n], such that the last bitmask represents the choices for the first i - 1 points and the last element gives the value of the last point choosen.`
- For the transition, we go through all the possible values of j such that j is not picked up in the suffix, and do the following : `dp[i][bitmask][last element] = dist(j, last_element)  + dp[i+1][bitmask | (1 << j)][j], store the minimum for all the values of j`
- base case: `dp[n][(1<<n)-1][anything] = 0`
- final answer: `dp[0][0][anything]`

## Optimisation:
- We can drop the index parameter from the main one, because the bitmask says the number of elements that have been choosen, and the index would be essentially number of set bits in the bitmask + 1. Hence we can optimise it since the value of the index can be derieved from the bitmask. 
- Hence the state would be `dp[bitmask][last element]`
