# Binomial Coefficients

nCr -> # of possible ways to select k items out of total n items.

nCr = n!/((n-k)!k!). 

## Interesting properties
```
1. C(n,k) = C(n, n-k)
2. C(n, k) = C(n-1,k-1) + C(n-1,k) ==> comes from pascals triangle/pascals table
3. C(n, 0) = C(n, n) = 1

You can build up a table of binomial coefficients using the pascals triangle
1
1 1
1 2 1
1 3 3 1
1 4 6 4 1
```

## Space and Time Optimised way to calculate C(n, k)

##### Approach:
```
1. Change r to n-r if r is greater than n-r. and create a variable to store the answer.
2. Run a loop from 0 to r-1
3. In every iteration update ans as (ans*(n-i))/(i+1) where i is the loop counter.
   So the answer will be equal to ((n/1)*((n-1)/2)*â€¦*((n-r+1)/r) which is equal to nCr.
4. TC -> O(r), SC = O(1);
```

##### Code
```cpp
int binomialCoeff(int n, int k)
{
    int res = 1;
 
    // Since C(n, k) = C(n, n-k)
    if (k > n - k)
        k = n - k;
 
    // Calculate value of
    // [n * (n-1) *---* (n-k+1)] / [k * (k-1) *----* 1]
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        res *= (n - i);
        res /= (i + 1);
    }
 
    return res;
}
```

## Short Formula's

```
1. Sum of the square of the all the binomial coefficients of n = 2nCn
2. Sum of all the binomial coefficients of n = 2^n;
3. Sum of all the even binomial coefficients of n = 2^n-1
```
