# Combinatorics 

## Basics

##### Warm Up Problem -> Birthday Paradox
```
What is the minimum number of people that should be present in a hall such that
there is atleast 50% chance of atleast two people having the same birthday?
```

##### Approach
```
Computing this probablitiy is directly is difficult, but it is easier to find
probability of all people having different birthdays(let's say this is x).
Thus, p(atleast 2 people) = 1 - x;

So we find x.

Assume there are two people in the hall, then probability that their birthdays
fall on different days -> (365/365)*(364/365) [First person has to choose one from 365, 
second has to choose one from 364. Then divided by the sample space(365*365)]

If there were 3 people, then the probability would be (365/365)*(364/365)*(363/365)

Thus we need to find the smallest n, such that the probability of having birthdays
on different days becomes less than 50%
```

##### Code
```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main(){
	float x;
	cin >> x;

	// corner case, if x = 1, ans = 366;
	if(x == 1.0){
		cout << 366 << endl;
		return 0;
	}

	float p = 1.0;
	int people = 0;

	while(p > 1 - x){
		p *= (365 - people) / 365.00;
		++people;
	}

	cout << people << endl;

}
```
