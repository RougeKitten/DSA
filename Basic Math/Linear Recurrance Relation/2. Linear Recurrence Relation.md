# Linear Recurrences

Eg of linear recurrence -> Fibonacci Series, Catalan Series, etc.

Type of Problems -> given a linear recurrence, find the n'th term of the linear recurrence.

#### Formal Defn
```
A Linear Recurrence is a sequence in which each term of the sequence is a linear combination of previous terms. 
The word "linear combination is imp"

f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) => is a LR
f(n) = f(n-1)*f(n-2) => is not a LR
```

### Solving Linear Recurrences
```
3 main approaches:
1. Recurrsion -> TC O(2^n)
2. DP -> TC O(n)
3. Matrix Exponentiation -> TC O(k^3 logn). [k = 2 for fib]
```
## Solving Linear Recurrences using Matrix Exponentiation.
```
Steps:
1. Find the value of k (no of prev terms on which f(n) depends).
 	f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) ==> k = 2;
 	f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) + f(n-4) ==> k = 4 [0*f(n-3)]
 	k => f(n - k) that is in the LR for f(n)
2. Find out the first k terms of the sequence. (must be given in the problem)
	Store this in a vector (F1)
	eg. for fib, F1 = [0]
					  [1]
3. Find the transformation matrix => a matrix of the size kxk such that
	T x Fi = Fi+1
	in the case of fib,
	T = 0 1   Fi-1 = f(i-2) 	F(i) = f(i-1)
	    1 1 		 f(i-1) 		   f(i-2) + f(i-1)
	Thus, a general trend => F(n) = TxF(n-1)
								  = TxTxF(n-2)	
								  = T^(n-1)*F(1)
4. TC = O(k3 logn) => K^3 from the matrix multiplication, logn from fast expon. 
```
#### Finding the transformation Matrix
```
eg) f(i) = f(i-1) + 2f(i-2) + 0f(1-3) + 4f(i-4)

Fi = [f(i-4), f(i-3), f(i-2), f(i-1)]. 
We need to find T such that T*F(i) = F(i+1)
F(i+1) = [f(i-3), f(i-2), f(i-1), f(i)]

Very easily basd on observation, we find that:
T = 0 1 0 0
	0 0 1 0
	0 0 0 1
	4 0 2 1

General Trend:
1. Last row will have the coefficients in reverse order, rest all the rows would 
be the identity matrix shifted by one col, with the first one to be zero. 

Edges case, if we have a constant term present in the recurrence relation, 
we just need to add that in F(i) and then find the appropriate T for it.

eg) f(i) = f(i-1) + 2f(i-2) + 0f(1-3) + 4f(i-4) + d; (k = 5)
T = 0 1 0 0 0
	0 0 1 0 0
	0 0 0 1 0
	4 0 2 1 1
	0 0 0 0 1
```
