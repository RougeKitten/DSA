# Common Bit Operations and Bit Masking

### Finding if a number is odd or even using bits

if last bit is 1 -> no is odd, else it's even

to check if last bit is odd, do bitwise and with 1. if output is 1, that means it's odd, else if is even

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
	int n;
	cin >> n;
	if(n & 1)
		cout << "Odd" << endl;
	else
		cout << "Even" << endl;
}
```

This is a very efficient method to find if a number is odd or even



### Getting the i<sup>th</sup> bit in a number

Approach for this -> create a mask.
* Create a number such who's i<sup>th</sup> bit is 1, rest all are zero (let's call this new number as the mask). We will use left shift operator for this.
* do bitwise and operation between the number and the mask. if the ans is greater than zero, means that the i<sup>th</sup> bit was 1, if the ans was zero, the i<sup>th</sup> bit was zero.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int main(){
	int n, i;
	cin >> n >> i;
	int mask = 1 << i; // mask will have only the ith bit set. 	
	cout << (int)((n & mask) > 0) << endl;
}
```

### Setting the i<sup>th</sup> bit of a number

Approach -> create a suitable mask and do bitwise or with that mask
* Mask -> 1 << i
* then perform an or with the number to get the ans

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int main(){
	int n, i;
	cin >> n >> i;
	int mask = 1 << i;
	cout << (n | mask) << endl;
}
```

### Clearing the i<sup>th</sup> bit of a number

3 step approach
* get a number who's i<sup>th</sup> bit is set(1 << i)
* negate this number to get our mask(this mask will have all bits as 1 except the ith bit, which will be 0)
* then perform an and operation between the two

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int main(){
	int n, i;
	cin >> n >> i;
	int mask = ~(1 << i);
	cout << (n & mask) << endl;
}
```
### Update bit at position i

You will be given a number n, a position i and another number v(either 0 or 1). You need to update the ith bit of the number to v.

Approach
* Clear the bit at that position. 
* create a mask such that v is at the i<sup>th</sup> place and all others are zero. Then perform OR operation.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main(){
	int n, i, v;
	cin >> n >> i >> v;
	// step 1: clearing the ith bit
	int mask = ~(1 << i);
	int ans = n & mask;
	// step 2, creating a mask and doing the or operation. 
	mask = v << i;
	ans = ans | mask;
	cout << ans << endl;
}
```

### Clear a Range of bits

PS -> Given a number n and a position i, we want to clear all the bits from position i to 0 

Approach
* Create a mask which would have the last i bits as 0 and the remaining as 1
* then perform and operation of this mask with the number

How to create the required mask?
* take the mask to be 1;
* right shift this mask by 1
* then perform an or operation with the previous mask to get the updated mask. 
* repeat this process i times. you will have the first i + 1 bits set in the number. 
* then negate it.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main(){
	int n, i;
	cin >> n >> i;

	int mask = 1;
	for(int j = 0; j < i; j++){
		mask = mask | (mask << 1);
	}
	mask = ~mask;

	int ans = n & mask;
	cout << ans << endl;
}
```

Alterate approach to get the desired mask
* Take a number which has all the 32 bits as 1 (binary -1)
* left shift this number i + 1 times to get the first i bits to be 0, rest to be 1

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main(){
	int n, i;
	cin >> n >> i;

	int mask = (-1 << i + 1);

	int ans = n & mask;
	cout << ans << endl;
}
```

### Clear a range of bits from i to j

Given n and to positions i and j, clear all the bits of n from position i to position j (inclusive of both)

Approach: we clearly need to have a mask which has 0 between i and j, remaining all places should be 1. Then we can and it to get the ans.

Getting the mask: we can divide the mask into 2 parts:
* take -1(all bits 1) and left shift it j + 1 times to get zero until jth position. 
* again take -1(all bits 1) and left shift it i times. then negate this number. 
* now take the or of the 2 numbers to get the desired mask. 

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main(){
	int n, i, j;
	cin >> n >> i >> j;
	int a = (-1 << j + 1);
	int b = ~(-1 << i);
	int ans = n & (a | b);
	cout << ans << endl;
}
```

the mask b just has i number of 1s. this is the equivalent of 2<sup>i</sup> - 1. 

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include<math.h>
using namespace std;

int main(){
	int n, i, j;
	cin >> n >> i >> j;
	int a = (-1 << j + 1);
	int b = (1<<i) - 1;
	int ans = n & (a | b);
	cout << ans << endl;
}
```
