# Generating Subsets using BitOps

## Problem

```
I/P -> "abc"
O/P -> "", a, b, c, ab, bc, ca, abc
```
## Approach

```
For every character in the string, there are 2 possible option: to be or not to be in the string. A total of 2^n subsets can be generated (8 in this case) including the null set.

Binary rep of numbers from 0 - 7
-  a b c
0  0 0 0 => ""
1  0 0 1 => a
2  0 1 0 => b
3  0 1 1 => ab
4  1 0 0 => c
5  1 0 1 => ac
6  1 1 0 => bc
7  1 1 1 => abc


here 0 represents a is not in the set, 1 represents it is present. 

We can make the last bit with the first character of the string and run a loop from 0 to 7. if the jth bit of i is set, s[j] will be present in the ith subset of the string.
```
## Code

```cpp
#include<iostream>

using namespace std;

void filter(string s, int n){
	int i = 0;
	while(n > 0){
		if(n&1){
			cout << s[i];
		}
		i++;
		n = n >> 1;
	}
	cout << endl;
}

int main() {
	string s;
	cin >> s;
	int n = s.length();

	for(int i = 0; i < (1 << n); i++){
		filter(s, i);
	}
}
```

TC -> O(2^n)
