## Approach

```
Let us see an example.
   arr[] = {2, 4, 7, 9, 2, 4}
1) Get the XOR of all the elements.
     xor = 2^4^7^9^2^4 = 14 (1110)
2) Get a number which has only one set bit of the xor.   
   Since we can easily get the rightmost set bit, let us use it.
     temp = xor & ~(xor-1) = (1110) & ~(1101) = 0010 (trick method based on observation)
   Now temp will have only one set bit which is the rightmost set bit of xor.
3) Now we find all the elements which have the same bit set which is set in temp (1 at pos 1) and get the XOR of all these numbers. 
   The result would be our first unique number. 
   The numbers having the same bit set as temp can be easily found by geting AND of them with temp. 
   res = 2^7^2 = 7. (only 2 and 7 have 1 at pos 1)
4) Now XOR this numbe with the xor to get the second unique number
    14^7 = 9 (why? because 14 is actually writting as 7^9)
   
   ```
   
   ## Code
   
  ```cpp
  class Solution
{
public:
    vector<int> singleNumber(vector<int> nums) 
    {
        // Code here
        int res = 0, n = nums.size();
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            res = res ^ nums[i];
        }
        
        int pos = res & ~(res - 1);
        
        int ans = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            if(nums[i] & pos){
                ans = ans ^ nums[i];
            }
        }
        vector<int> temp;
        temp.push_back(ans);
        temp.push_back(res ^ ans);
        
        sort(temp.begin(), temp.end());
        return temp;
    }
};
```

TC -> O(n), SC -> O(1)
