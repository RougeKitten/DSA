# Inclusion Exclusion Principle

## Theory
``` 
|A U B| = |A| + |B| - |A !U B|
|A U B U C | = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A!U B| - |B !U C| - |C !U A| + |A !U B !U C|

To generalise this trend: 
1. If we are combining odd set, sign would be positive. 
2. else it would be even. 

Effectivly, we need to generate all subsets of the set. If any subset has odd no of elements, add it, else substract it. 
```

## Problem
```
How many numbers are there less than 1000 which are divisible by either 2, 3 or 5?

No's divisible by 2 = floor(999/2) = 499
No's divisible by 3 = floor(999/3) = 333
No's divisible by 5 = floor(999/5) = 199
No's divisible by 2&3 = floor(999/2*3) = 166
No's divisible by 3&5 = floor(999/3*5) = 66
No's divisible by 5&2 = floor(999/5*2) = 99
No's divisible by 2,3,5 = floor(999/2*3*5) = 33

Ans = 499 + 333 + 199 - 166 - 66 - 99 + 33 = 733
```

## Approach
```
1. Take all the numbers in an array [2,3,5]
2. Generate all the non empty subsets of this array. 
3. Get the floor values of the product of numbers in each subset with N.
4. If the no of elements in the subset is odd, add it to the ans. If even, substract it. 

```

## Code
```cpp
#include<iostream>

using namespace std;

int main(){
	int n, m; // n = upper limit (1000), m = no of elements (3 in the case of 2,3,5)
	int arr[100];
	cin >> n >> m;
	for(int i = 0; i < m; i++){
		cin >> arr[i];
	}
	int ans = 0;
	for(int i = 1; i < (1<<m); i++){
		int temp = i, j = 0, count = 0, val = 1;
		while(temp > 0){
			if(temp&1){
				val *= arr[j];
				count++;
			}
			j++;
			temp = temp >> 1;
		}
		if(count & 1){
			ans += (n/val);
		}
		else
			ans -= (n/val);
	}
	cout << ans << endl;
}
```

## Sample Question
```
After the release of Avengers, Ironman and Thor got into a fight and Ironman challenged Thor to find out the number of 
numbers between 1 and n which are divisible by any of the prime numbers less than 20. Ironman being great at maths 
quickly answered the question but then Thor asked him to write a program for it. Ironman however found it quite 
difficult as he did not wanted to write so many lines of code. he knows that you are smart and can code this up 
easily. Can you do it?

	while(t--){
		int n;
		cin >> n;
		int ans = 0;
		for(int i = 1; i < (1<<8); i++){
			int temp = i, j = 0, count = 0, val = 1;
			while(temp > 0){
				if(temp&1){
					count++;
					val *= arr[j];
				}
				j++;
				temp = temp >> 1;
			}
			if(count&1)
				ans += (n/val);
			else
				ans -=(n/val);
		}
		cout << ans << endl;
	}
}
