# Insert M in N at given positions

link for the problem -> https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/insertion-m-n-m-starts-bit-j-ends-bit/

### Input:

`n = 1024, m = 19, i = 2, j = 6
 n in binary = 10000000000
 m in binary = 10011
 ans in binary = 10001001100`

### Approach
<p>1. clear the bits in the range of i, j in n (previously discussed how to do it)</p>
 <p>2. now that the range from i to j is clear, we simply need to align m in that range and do OR(rest all should be zero). We do this in two steps:)</p>
 	<p>a. left shift m by i (so that m starts from i))</p>
 	<p>b. add the left shift with 2^(j + 1) -1 to set all the bits from pos j + 1 to be zero)</p>
 <p>3. Now just or these two things)</p>

 ### Code
 ```cpp
 #include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main(){
	int n, m, i, j;
	cin >> n >> m >> i >> j;

	//clearing bits of n in the range of i to j
	int a = (-1 << j + 1);
	int b = (1 << i) - 1;
	int ans = n & (a | b);

	// getting m made in the given format.
	int c = m << i;
	int d = (1 << j + 1) - 1;

	ans = ans | (c & d);
	cout << ans << endl;
}
```
