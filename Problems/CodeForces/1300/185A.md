## Approach:
```
Let's propose, that after the i-th year, there is x triangles up and y triangles down. 
After another iteration we can see, that amount of triangles became — 3x + y up and 
x + 3y down. Let's see the difference between them: at the i-th it's x - y and at 
the i + 1-th — it's (3x + y) - (x + 3y) = 2 * (x - y). We can see, that difference
between amount of triangles grown up by 2. Because on the i-th year the difference 
became 2i and all amount of triangles is 4i. We can see, that on the i-th year the 
number of our triangles is . That can be computed by modulo p using the fast-power
algorithm.
