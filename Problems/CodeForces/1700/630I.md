## Approach
```
There are the following ways to place n cars of the same make. They can be the first n, 
the last n, or they can be somewhere in the middle of the parking lot.

When n cars of the same make are the first or the last, there are 4 ways to choose the 
make of these n cars, then there are 3 ways to choose the make of one car adjacent to 
them (the make should be different from the make of n cars) and there are 4 ways to 
choose the make of each of the remaining n - 3 cars. So the formula for the case of n 
cars of the same make on either end of the parking lot is 4·3·4^n - 3.

When n cars of the same make are situated somewhere in the middle, there are 4 ways to 
choose the make of these n cars, then there are 3 ways to choose the make of each of two 
cars adjacent to them (the makes of these two cars should be different from the make of n cars) 
and there are 4 ways to choose the make of each of the remaining n - 4 cars. So the formula for 
the case of n cars of the same make on a given position somewhere in the middle of the parking 
lot is 4·3^2·4^n - 4.

There are 2 positions of n cars of the same make in the end of the parking lot and there are n - 3 
positions of n cars of the same make somewhere in the middle of the parking lot. So the final formula is 
2·4·3·4^n - 3 + (n - 3)·4·3^2·4^n - 4.
