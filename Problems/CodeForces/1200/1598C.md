# Approach
- This problem is fairly easy, but the constraints are bad on this one. 
- Sorting or using double will give you TLE
- We see the two elements to be deleted will have a sum equal to ```2*sum/n```. 
- Hence, store the count of the frequency of each element of the array in a map. If the other element is present, we add it's frequency to the ans.
- However, if the two numbers are same, then we need to substract one after we have added the frequency (factor of nC2). 
- Finally, we have to divide the ans by 2, because we are couinting 2 pairs in this for every number. 

# Code
```cpp

#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int main() {
	int t;
	scanf("%d", &t);
	while (t--) {
		int n;
		scanf("%d", &n);
		vector<int> a(n);
		map<int, int> cnt;
		for (auto &x : a) {
			scanf("%d", &x);
			cnt[x] += 1;
		}
		long long sum = accumulate(a.begin(), a.end(), 0LL);
		if ((2 * sum) % n != 0) {
			puts("0");
			continue;
		}
		long long need = (2 * sum) / n;
		long long ans = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
			int a1 = a[i];
			int a2 = need - a1;
			if (cnt.count(a2)) ans += cnt[a2];
			if (a1 == a2) ans -= 1;
		}
		printf("%lld\n", ans / 2);
	}
}
