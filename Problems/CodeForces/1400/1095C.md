## Approach
```
On observing the bits of n, we come to the following conclusions:
1. Answer is possible if k <= n [at max, we can say it was a sum of n 1's]
2. Answer is possible if k >= the no of set bits present in n [observations]

So based on these 2 observations we develop a greedy approach as follows:
1. If n has a setbit at the ith position, we will add 1 << i (2^i) to a maxHeap. 
2. After this, while the size of the maxHeap is not equal to k, we will:
   a. Pop the top element
   b. divide this top element by 2 and add this divided no twice.
   c. increment k.
```

## Code
```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;


int main(){

	int n, k;
	cin >> n >> k;

	if(k > n){
		cout << "NO";
		return 0;
	}

	priority_queue<int> maxHeap;
	int j = 1;
	while(j <= n){
		if(j&n){
			maxHeap.push(j);
			--k;
		}
		j = j << 1;
	}

	if(k < 0){
		cout << "NO";
		return 0;
	}
	cout << "YES" << endl;
	
	while(k > 0){
		int front = (maxHeap.top()) >> 1;
		maxHeap.pop();
		maxHeap.push(front);
		maxHeap.push(front);
		--k;
	}

	while(!maxHeap.empty()){
		cout << maxHeap.top() << " ";
		maxHeap.pop();
	}

}
```
